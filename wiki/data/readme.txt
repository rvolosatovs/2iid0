Info about dataset:
This is a temporal dataset with time windows, meaning every edge has a start and end time. this dataset was created from the http://konect.uni-koblenz.de/networks/link-dynamic-nlwiki dataset in which every edge had an indication of when it was added and removed, after filtering this dataset was the result.

Dataset type:
I would say dynamic, but considering it uses 2 labels, aka time windows it may not fit in any category at all

example set:
src trg start end
